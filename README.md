# Overwatch League Filter API
This is a model of a filter for [Overwatch League's API](https://api.overwatchleague.com) to use with [BLiP's Builder](https://blip.ai).
The filter is entirely OpenSource so feel free to submit PR's.

## Documentation
*Swagger* documentation is available [here](https://owleague-203521.appspot.com). I will provide a text doc here ASAP, both from this filter and OWL's API.
